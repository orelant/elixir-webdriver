    Version: #{ WebDriver.Mixfile.project[:version] }

    This is the Elixir WebDriver application. It can be used to drive a
    WebDriver enabled browser via Elixir code.

    The current version supports PhantomJS, ChromeDriver, FireFox and remote
    Web Driver servers (e.g. Selenium).

    All drivers except 'remote' manage running the browser in the application
    supervision tree.

    This code is written to be very similar to the Selenium bindings for other
    languages.

      Configuration for a WebDriver browser instance.
      Note that this record will have fields added as development of
      the library progresses.

      * `browser` - The type of browser, :phantomjs or :firefox
      * `name` - An atom to refer to the browser for later calls.
      * `root_url` - Used only for the Remote driver. This is the base url
      of the webdriver server. It must be a complete URL eg: "http://localhost:5555/wd/hub"
      This value is ignored for the other drivers, which set up their own root_url.

    Start a browser with the given configuration.
    The _config_ parameter is a WebDriver.Config struct defined as

    ``` defstruct  browser: :phantomjs, name: nil, root_url: "" ```

    Currently Config is very minimal, future versions will add to this.
    Browser can be eithes :phantomjs or :firefox.

    *Note that at the moment Firefox support is highly experimental.*

    The name parameter is an atom with which you can reference the browser
    process for further calls.

    Returns ```{:ok, pid}``` or ```{:error, reason}```

    Example:

      iex> config = %WebDriver.Config{browser: :phantomjs, name: :test_browser}
      iex> WebDriver.start_browser config
      Starting phantomjs
      Phantom js started
